# Book Search Engine Starter Code

## Description

I created a Google Books search engine using the public Google API. Users can sign up and save books. The project was built with REACT, NodeJs, ExpressJs, and NoSQL. It started as a Restful API and was transformed into GraphQL, condensing multiple routes into one endpoint for Queries and Mutations. Data is stored in a MongoDB database, and user access is controlled by JWT. This MERN Stack project utilizes Apollo Client for GraphQL, along with Mongoose and NodeJs packages. It's live on Heroku.
